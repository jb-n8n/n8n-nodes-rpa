# Changelog

All notable changes to `n8n-nodes-rpa` and the `rpa-browser` image. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); until 1.0, a minor version may change behavior. The node is released with
`v<version>` tags, the image with `browser-v<version>` tags.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-26)

First public release: the node `n8n-nodes-rpa` 0.1.0 on npm and the image `ghcr.io/jb-n8n/rpa-browser:0.1.0`
(Playwright 1.63.0).

### The node

- **Quick operations**: Screenshot, Get Page, Save as PDF, Extract Data (table or list), Fill and Submit Form, Download
  File. A URL and one or two fields; GET only, except the form's own submit.
- **Run Steps**: a JSON list of browser steps for sites behind a login, with a Site Login credential (username, password,
  TOTP) whose secrets reach the page only through a sign-in step and are masked everywhere. Optional AI Repair: when
  the steps stop matching the site, a chat model finds the data in the same browser, the engine compiles its actions
  into new steps and proves them in a fresh browser with no model and no writes. The repaired steps carry the proof
  run's trace for the reviewer.
- **Sign Steps**: signs approved steps with an HMAC key; Run Steps refuses unsigned or edited steps by default.
- **Import Steps**: turns a Chrome Recorder export, Playwright code or a UiPath project into steps for approval. Typed
  passwords are never imported, imports never write, and what passes a fresh-browser replay comes out on Repaired
  Steps for Sign Steps. A UiPath import also returns the rest of the bot as an n8n workflow file, in which each browser
  sequence has AI Repair on and sends its repairs to approval.
  - An imported sign-in keeps a "Stay signed in?" answer (No, Yes or "Don't show this again") in the login block, and a
    code typed from a UiPath TOTP activity becomes the sign-in's code (the Site Login's authenticator types a fresh one).
  - With an Expected File, a dialog's confirming click (Continue, OK, Save) that ends the recording after the export
    click, with no address change or URL check between them, becomes the download.
- **Two-page sign-ins**: `signIn.next` for identity-first sign-ins (email, Next, password, as Microsoft Entra and Okta
  do); the agent and the importers build it. A rejected username is `login_failed` when the site sends the username
  page back; an inline error on the same page times out as drift, and AI repair is not attempted once the username was
  typed.
- **Self-healing downloads**: download steps can declare file checks (name, type, columns, rows), enforced on every run;
  AI repair of steps that download one checked file; **Expected File** for a first run; the file's facts as evidence in
  the review and checked by Sign Steps.
  - File checks find the header in the first 10 non-empty rows, and the CSV delimiter is the one with consistent
    per-line counts (semicolon files with decimal commas work).
  - A repair keeps the click of a failed download trigger that opened a dialog (for example an Export → format popup),
    shown in the change list as "Open <trigger>". When the agent itself tries a download on such a control and the
    click opens a dialog without a file, the click is kept as a successful click before the agent's dialog steps.
  - Downloads refuse a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) browser connection up front with a configuration error: CDP
    cannot read downloaded files.
- **Requests That Only Read** on the Site Login: POSTs that only read (for example an OData `$batch` or a report
  screen's postback) pass in every run, are never counted as writes, and are listed in the review evidence.
- **Repairs**: typed filter values that equal one run variable compile to `{{var.*}}`, and the agent's prompt carries the
  run's variable names and masked values. Repairs no longer propose `#id` fallbacks on generated ids (SAP, UI5, React,
  Ember, hex salts) or `href` fallbacks carrying a session segment. A repair fills each field once. The agent sees what
  a field already holds, but never a value on a login page or in a credential-class field. Proofs open the work's entry
  page with the reused session, so sites that keep window state on the server (such as SAP GUI for HTML) prove.
- **Approval**: the approval text renders every value on one line and quotes values that could fake a clause. A pending
  proposal with an unsafe value, or a download step with no checks (shown as `checks: no checks`), is refused at Sign
  Steps once and must be produced again. When "RPA: 3 Approve steps" activates a version, older `active` rows of the
  same name become `superseded`.
- **Queue mode**: with several n8n workers, an **RPA Redis** credential on Run Steps shares the login breaker and the
  run lock between them; a lock left by a worker that died frees itself. In queue mode, Run Steps with a Site Login
  and no Redis credential is a configuration error.
- **Browser service**: runs wait up to 60 s for a free browser session, then fail `browser_unavailable` with "no free
  browser session"; the credential test passes when every session is busy. With Slow Motion on, a live view shows the
  running step in Browser Server mode too.
- **Step schema**: a JSON Schema of the step document (`dist/schema/steps.schema.json`) for editor autocomplete.
- **Templates**: Hello world, "RPA: 0 Connection check" (proves the browser reaches your site), the self-healing data
  feed (create tables, the feed, approve repaired steps) and "RPA: 5 Import a bot" (a form in front of Import Steps,
  with approval through "RPA: 3 Approve steps").
- **Safety**: a per-run site allowlist, private networks blocked by default, writes only where steps declare them,
  a login breaker and a run lock per Site Login, scrubbed browser traces.
- **Browser connections**: a browser server over the Playwright protocol (such as Browserless or the `rpa-browser`
  image), Chrome DevTools Protocol, or a local browser for development. Slow Motion for live views and debugging.

### The browser service

- **The `rpa-browser` image**: Playwright's run-server behind a token gate, with a supervisor under tini. A session
  limit per replica (`503` busy), `/healthz`, Prometheus metrics on port 9464, drain on stop, and optional ECS task
  protection and CloudWatch EMF metrics. Published to GHCR for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 with a build attestation.
- **Helm chart** `deploy/helm/rpa-browser` (KEDA, CPU or fixed scaling; NetworkPolicy; optional Cilium FQDN policy) and
  **Terraform modules** `k8s-browser` and `aws-ecs-browser`, with eks-attach, ecs-attach and EKS-managed
  (`terraform-aws-n8n`) examples. The token never enters Terraform state.
- `deploy/scripts/configure-n8n.mjs` creates the RPA Browser credential and imports the templates through n8n's public
  API; runbooks for Kubernetes and Amazon ECS in `docs/deploy/`.

### Sandbox (repository only, not in the package)

- The sandbox site gained an SAP look-alike (a classic web GUI and a Fiori list report), a realistic mode with an SAP
  logon, SAP GUI for HTML and an OpenUI5 Fiori app, single sign-on with MFA in front of it (`SANDBOX_SAP_LOGIN=sso`),
  and an identity-first mode (`SANDBOX_SAP_LOGIN=sso2`, with an optional "Stay signed in?" page, `IDP_KMSI`), with an
  onboarding runbook in `docs/onboarding/`.
